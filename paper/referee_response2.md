Response to the reviewer

We thank the reviewer for their additional comments, which continue to be helpful in improving the clarity of our manuscript.

> 1/The Abstract need to be more thoroughly revised, in line with the text. I see no harm to the paper to state assumptions and applications in the abstract as clearly as they are in (new) last 2 paragraphs of Sect. 3 or in the 'rebuttalâ€™.

As suggested, we have edited the abstract to state the assumptions and primary applications more clearly. 


> 2/Perhaps it is a matter of taste, but I found most of Sect. 1 unnecessary
general and confusing while at the same time on first page of their 'rebuttal'
(the paragraphs starting with 'The primary use...' and 'Even if observations...')
the purpose and restriction of the method are explained in a crystal clear way.
Substitution of that text for parts part of the paper Introduction would only enhance the appeal of the paper, in my opinion.

We have edited the introduction for clarity and removed or reworded parts to make it less confusing. We have also, as suggested, substituted part of the introduction with the text from our response.

> 3/For illustrative purposes, I would suggest to degrade slightly (decrease number of simulations) Fig.4, so that the effect of random scatter around theoretical distribution was better graphically visible, with a suitable comment it is small sample behavior only. The new Fig. 8 suffices to demonstrate 
perfect match of histogram ant theoretical distributions in the large sample case.

As suggested, we have slightly decreased the number of simulations in Figure 4, which now shows the scatter around the theoretical distribution is more apparent, and have indicated this in the caption.
