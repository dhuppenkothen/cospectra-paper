abstract={Her X-1, one of the brightest and best studied X-ray binaries, shows a cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF) near 37 keV. This makes it an ideal target for a detailed study with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array ( NuSTAR ), taking advantage of its excellent hard X-ray spectral resolution. We observed Her X-1 three times, coordinated with Suzaku , during one of the high flux intervals of its 35 day superorbital period. This paper focuses on the shape and evolution of the hard X-ray spectrum. The broadband spectra can be fitted with a power law with a high-energy cutoff, an iron line, and a CRSF. We find that the CRSF has a very smooth and symmetric shape in all observations and at all pulse phases. We compare the residuals of a line with a Gaussian optical-depth profile to a Lorentzian optical-depth profile and find no significant differences, strongly constraining the very smooth shape of the line. Even though the line energy changes dramatically with pulse phase, we find that its smooth shape does not. Additionally, our data show that the continuum only changes marginally between the three observations. These changes can be explained with varying amounts of Thomson scattering in the hot corona of the accretion disk. The average, luminosity-corrected CRSF energy is lower than in past observations and follows a secular decline. The excellent data quality of NuSTAR provides the best constraint on the CRSF energy to date.}

abstract="In this chapter we present the theory of a class of multivariate laws that we term asymmetric Laplace (AL) distributions [see Kozubowski and Podg{\'o}rski (1999bc), Kotz et al. (2000b)]. The class is an extension of both the symmetric multivariate Laplace distributions and the univariate AL distributions that were discussed in previous chapters. This extension retains the natural, asymmetric, and multivariate features of the properties characterizing these two important subclasses. In particular, the AL distributions arise as the limiting laws in a random summation scheme with i.i.d. terms having a finite second moment, where the number of terms in the summation is geometrically distributed independently of the terms themselves. This class can be viewed as a subclass of hyperbolic distributions and some of its properties are inherited from them. However, to demonstrate an elegant theoretical structure of the multivariate AL laws and also for the sake of simplicity we prefer direct derivations of the results. Thus we provide explicit formulas for the probability density and the density of the L{\'e}vy measure. The results presented also include characterizations, mixture representations, formulas for moments, a simulation algorithm, and a brief discussion of linear regression models with AL errors.",
